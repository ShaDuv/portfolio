          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>Oregon has always been my home although I moved to Portland only 5 years ago. Logic and creativity are always in an intense arm wrestling match in my head to see which on will go over the top at the last second. I believe love superceeds all and try to act accordingly. Adventure is good for my soul. I am a board game geek, a dog lover, a non-picky self-labeled wine "snob" (AKA I like most of it), a coffee drinker, a sushi eater and a total water baby.</p>
          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>After a few different 9 to 5 jobs I ended up with an opportunity to go back to school. I started out with early childhood development and education and while I loved the psychology part of it I wanted something that would offer the opportunity to work remotely from time to time. I moved into a graphic design degree and graduated in the top of my class.</P>
          <p>I took an “entry level” job with a startup doing conversion optimization, persona development, and split testing. The diversity of managing the copywriting , creating the wireframes for the interns to make, and getting to gorge myself on as much data about a site as I could get my hands on was all right in my wheelhouse.  After a while I wanted to move up in salary, and wanted to have a bigger challenge. My partner had a job offer in Portland and so we moved.</p>
          <p>Getting into User Research and UX/UI with absolutely no programming seemed to be impossible so I accepted a position in a trucking company. In a very short period of time I worked my way into management about the time they bought out 4 other companies and decided to change the software we were using. It was left up to me to work with the SQL programmers to make automation happen between the CRM and the routing software. With no formal knowledge of SQL I was the primary point of contact for all troubleshooting and “is this possible “conversations.  It was obvious that programming concepts came natural to me even if the syntax was unknown, and so, after some time, I decided to get into programming. </p>
          <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
          <p>My hobbies and interests are as varied as everything else in my life. I love to travel and when I do I try to take advantage of being an advanced open water Scuba diver since the water on the Pacific coast is too cold for my tastes. I occasionally do archery which is noted by the bruises on my forearm; just because I like it doesn’t mean I am good at it yet. Theater is a passion of mine that I have not had time for in recent years. Doing improvisational comedy (“Whose Line Is it Anyway” style) was some of the happiest times in my life. Finally, <strong>I am fascinated by psychology and the way humans think and act.</strong> I am usually studying some form of psychology and I am looking to push more into ways to educate people on human sexuality and the way our psyche plays a part in that. </p>

              <p>Being a curious creature I have a degreen in Graphic Design from Westwood Univerity (2011), a certification in Advanced Hypnosis and Neuro-Linguistic Programming, and soon a certification in Ruby and React. I find learning new things to be one of the real pleasures in life. If I am not challenged I am bored. Reading books on human behavior, psychology, and business tends to carry me between these bigger learning pushes I put myself through.</p>

              <p>Much like my learning my experience has been extremely varied. Most employers move me up and through various positions when they realize that I am an extremely fast learner, not afraid of change, a unique problem solver, and self-motivated. I have started with 6 months in the basement followed by a view from the penthouse and within a year I am some form of a strategist. I like the challenge and I love growing and seeing things improve. Efficiency is like a drug to me and I am often looking for ways to automate or shortcut unnecessary steps.<p>
